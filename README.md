# Capstan-Drive
A capstan drive is a rope-driven speed reducer that is cheap, has low backlash, low inertia, low noise, and high torque transparency. 
When it comes to building robots these benefits are quite important. This test stand has the following features:

-Fully 3D printed

-Weighs 852g

-120Â° rotation

-8.55:1 reduction (quasi-direct drive)

-Helical pattern on both drums for guided unraveling

-Lead screw to tension the rope

-ODrive S1 FOC Controller

-Eagle Power 90KV BLDC Motor
